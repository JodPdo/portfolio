/**
 * Shared Open Graph / Twitter builder (PF-M3-07 + PF-M3-08).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: Next.js `Metadata` objects do NOT deep-merge across the
 * layout→page hierarchy. Any child route that declares its own `openGraph`
 * (or `twitter`) key REPLACES the parent's whole object rather than merging
 * into it — so a partial child override silently drops the root's OG image
 * (PF-M3-07: all 4 case studies lost `og:image`) and a page that declares NO
 * override at all inherits the root's `url: "/"`/home title verbatim
 * (PF-M3-08: /about, /contact, /resume, /projects showed the homepage's
 * og:title/description/url). The file-convention image in
 * `app/opengraph-image.tsx` is likewise only auto-attached to routes that do
 * not override `openGraph`, so any overriding route must re-declare it.
 *
 * FIX: every route (root layout, the 4 secondary pages, and the dynamic
 * case-study route) calls this one helper, which always returns a COMPLETE
 * `openGraph` + `twitter` pair — correct per-page title/description/url/type,
 * plus the shared OG image — so no route can ship a partial object that
 * clobbers the image or leaks the homepage's identity.
 */

/**
 * The root `app/opengraph-image.tsx` file-convention route. Referencing it
 * explicitly (rather than relying on auto-attachment) is what survives a child
